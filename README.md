Hello World Engines convert (some) Heat to Work
Second Law of thermodynamics
CLAUSIUS: Heat canâ€™t flow from colder to hotter
KELVIN/PLANCK: Cannot convert ALL heat to work
CARNOT: Best possible heat engine between T1 and T2 is...
a) Reversible
b) Has all heat transfer at exactly T1 and T2.
i.e. Reversible isothermal/adiabatic Carnot cycle
Carnot cycle is not generally useful: isothermal = slow, so very low power
(Finn: 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.10)
Carnot Efficiency
Thermodynamic temperature scale.
Carnot devices.
A (nearly) real engine.
